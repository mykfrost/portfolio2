          That’s what’s cool about working with computers. They don’t argue,
          they remember everything, and they don’t drink all your beer. (Paul
          Leary) It is not about bits, bytes and protocols, but profits, losses
          and margins. (Lou Gerstner) As soon as we started programming, we
          found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as
          we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the
          exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then
          on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.
          (Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949) Windows NT addresses 2
          Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than any application will ever need.
          (Microsoft, on the development of Windows NT, 1992)

          Software is like sex: It’s better when it’s free. (Linus Torvalds)
          Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with
          millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural
          integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. (Alan
          Kay) The Internet? Is that thing still around? (Homer Simpson) It
          would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to
          achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with
          such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John
          Von Neumann, circa 1949)
